<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am **Xiaohui Wang**, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Information Science and Technology at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tao Chen](https://eetchen.github.io/) at the Fudan EDL Lab. I also work closely with Dr. Peng Ye (Postdoc at [MMLab@CUHK](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk). My research interests lie in **Efficient AI**, **Multi-Modal AI**, and **Embodied AI**.

I am proud to have received the **National Scholarship (2022-2023)** for my academic achievements, with a GPA of **93/100**. I am passionate about exploring ways to enhance AI systems for more efficient and versatile real-world applications.

This summer, I will be joining [MMLab@HKU](https://mmlab.hk) as a **research intern** under the supervision of [Prof. Ping Luo](http://luoping.me/). I am excited to work alongside talented researchers.

<span style="color:blue;">If you are interested in connecting, collaborating, or discussing ideas, feel free to reach out to me via email. I am also seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026. You can access my CV [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/187rZdZZIrTxQpYSrKbO4YIWrrETO6eEs/view?usp=drive_link).</span>

[Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.13563)

<span style="color:blue;">**Xiaohui Wang**</span>\*, Peng Ye\*, Chenyu Huang, Shenghe Zheng, Bo Zhang, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen&#8224;

<span style="color:red;">(Accepted by NeurIPS 2025)</span>

- To break the compression ceiling of delta weights, we analyze the limitations of existing methods in information preservation and model stability, and propose UltraDelta, the first data-free pipeline enabling ultra-efficient delta compression, achieving both ultra-high compression ratios and strong performance without relying on any data.

[Seeing Delta Parameters as JPEG Images: Data-Free Delta Compression with Discrete Cosine Transform](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06676)

Chenyu Huang\*, Peng Ye\*, <span style="color:blue;">**Xiaohui Wang**</span>, Shenghe Zheng, Biqing Qi, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen&#8224;

- Motivated by the classic JPEG compression, we explore the delta compression from the DCT domain for the first time. We first realize data-free delta compression and further reduce the performance degradation. We propose a framework based on compression in the DCT domain, named DELTA-DCT.
